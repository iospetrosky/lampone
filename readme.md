Repository: lampone

Purpose: keep track of all the applications, scripts, etc for the raspberry pi. Mainly python. Marginally, there's a folder for the micro bit.

tileset\_tools is ignored, possibly to be moved somewhere else
doc is also ignored



Note: this is a backup of the library before a new start with only useful scripts. All tests, old stuff is deleted in the new main. Do not delete this branch unless you really want to get rid of the past development
